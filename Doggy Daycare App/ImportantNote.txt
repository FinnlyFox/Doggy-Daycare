This note is purely to explain how the webpage works for the different types of users.

UNSIGNED IN USERS:
    They can view the home page (A short introduction to the company [Doggy Daycare])
    They CANNOT view the Bookings tab AND the ADD_BOOKINGS tab is hidden for anyone that is not staff.

SIGNED IN USERS:
    They can view the home page AND the Bookings page.
    They CANNOT see the other ADD_BOOKING tab as they are not staff users.
    They CANNOT Update/Delete Bookings in the Bookings page.

STAFF USERS (ADMIN OR SET UP RECEPTIONIST PROFILE):
    They have FULL access to the website.
    They can view everything (IF THEY ARE LOGGED IN).
    They can ADD UPDATE AND DELETE Bookings.

Now I want to explain what each page is on my site since it is kinda simple.

HOME PAGE:
    This is just a small "ad" you could say for the company, It gives some small information about the company and such.

BOOKINGS:
    This page allows you to see, update and delete (if you are a staff member) Bookings as needed.

UPDATE/ADD BOOKINGS:
    Both are form pages that do what they say they do... Update and Add Bookings to the Bookings list.

I will also make the receptionist login details for you.

They are:
    username: Manager
    password: doggy_daycare_receptionist

Thank you for your time.
