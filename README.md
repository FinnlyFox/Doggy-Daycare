# Django Project (Doggy Daycare)

## Description

This is my Django project for Capstone 1 in Hyperion Dev's Software Engineering Boot Camp.
This site is insipred by TrelloÂ© (but for pets!)

It allows logged in users to view bookings that have been added by a receptionist (admin user for the Django site)

  - Can view and add bookings on the web page
