# Django Project (Doggy Daycare)

## Description

This is my Django project for Capstone 1 in Hyperion Dev's Software Engineering Boot Camp.
This site is insipred by TrelloÂ© (but for pets!)

It allows logged in users to view bookings that have been added by a receptionist (admin user for the Django site)

### Unsigned In User
  - Cannot view anything except for the home/login page

### Regular User
  - Can view bookings

### Admin User
  - Can view and add bookings on the web page

## Installation

In order to install this site, I will assume a few things:
1. You are on a Windows device (if not check the commands for your system instead [it will be the same commands just different syntax]).

1. You have Pip installed.

1. You have Python installed.

1. You have a code editor installed (my project was created in VSC).

1. You have a DockerHub account.

1. You have Docker Desktop set up on your pc.

## Bash commands (Start up server)
1. Open a CMD/Powershell terminal

   win + "cmd"

1. Chnage into your working directory

   ```bash
   cd to/path/of/your/choice

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FinnlyFox/Doggy-Daycare.git

1. Change into the main project directory (The sturcure I created)

   ```bash
   cd Doggy-Daycare

1. (Optional but recommended) Set up a virtual environment

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

1. Activate the virtual environment

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate

1. Change into the django project directory

   ```bash
   cd MySite

1. (Optional if you wish to access the admin features of the site) Create an admin user

   To log into the admin section use [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin) after the server is running.
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   
   - EXAMPLE -
   Username: admin
   Email address: admin@example.com
   Password: ********
   Password (again): ********

1. Login to your DockerHub account in the terminal

   P.S. Please make sure you have the website (DockerHub) open during this step, since I had problems until I opened it.

   ```bash
   docker login

1. Use the Docker image to create a Docker container

   P.S. Open the Dockerfile in your IDE (Just so that the IDE knows what the file contains[It somtimes has issues]) before doing this command.

   ```bash
    docker build -t "NameOfYourContainer" .

1. Run the server on local host

   Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to view the website.

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 "NameOfYourContainer"

## Bash commands (Shut down server)

1. Run this command to view the ID of the Image

   ```bash
   docker ps

1. Enter the first 3 characters of the ID with this command to shut down the Image

   ```bash
   docker stop _ _ _

1. Change directories back to the main directory

   ```bash
   cd..

1. Deactivate the virtual environment

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\deactivate

1. Close the CMD/Powershell terminal.

1. Good Bye!
